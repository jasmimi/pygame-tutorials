# Pygame Tutorials Upskilling Progress
To assist in our final group project report and portfolio for 'RaspberryPi Arcade', Python library Pygame is used. This repository is evidence of the required upskilling in this library. File: 'reaction.py' is a prototype for one of the included arcade games. File: 'paperscissorsrock.py' is a WIP game.


## How to run Reaction
```
python reaction.py
```
This game will prompt the user to prepare to press the SPACE key on the start screen. 1-15 seconds later, a red screen will display alerting the user to press the SPACE key. If the user presses SPACE prematurely (early), they lose the game. If the user presses SPACE after the red screen appears (expected), they win the game and are presented with their reaction time.

## How to run Paper, Scissors, Rock (WIP)
```
python paperscissorsrock.py
```
This game will prompt the user to prepare to press the SPACE key on the start screen, this will move the user to the instructions page. 10 seconds later, round 1 begins with a 3 second countdown timer. The result of the round is shown for 5 seconds. This process repeats for rounds 2 and 3. The game ends on the final result screen, showing which player won the best of the 3 rounds.
